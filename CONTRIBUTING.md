# Contributing to Brain-Tumor-Detection

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Brain-Tumor-Detection** project!  
This repository focuses on medical image analysis and classification of MRI scans to detect brain tumors using machine learning and deep learning. Contributions from data scientists, developers, researchers, and beginners are all welcome!



## 🧠 How You Can Contribute

### 🔹 Data Enhancements
- Add or expand datasets (more MRI scans, different formats, multiple modalities).
- Improve preprocessing pipelines (noise removal, normalization, resizing).

### 📊 Model Improvements
- Experiment with different CNN/Deep Learning architectures (VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet).
- Implement data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
- Compare evaluation metrics across models (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

### 🩺 Evaluation & Metrics
- Add ROC curves, confusion matrices, AUC scores.
- Implement cross-validation & reporting scripts.

### 📚 Documentation & Tutorials
- Improve the README with clear instructions.
- Add how-to guides for training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Provide example inference steps and sample outputs.

### 🧰 Deployment & UI
- Add a simple web interface or GUI for uploading MRI scans and viewing results.
- Provide Docker support or API endpoint for model integration.
